Downloads Corruption+'s songs for the battle microphone into data/fnf/songs/.

Friday Night Funkin': Corruption+ is Carlito049's fan extension of Phantom Fear and Pincer's
Corruption mod (gamejolt.com/games/fnfcorruptionplus/793089). Its Demo 1 has three weeks: Kapi's
arcade (Wild Eyed, Claws, Growl), Skarlet Bunny's hunt (Vile Vice, Feral, Broken Wires) and Carol's
church (Lullaby, Cursed, Purification). Carlito lets its music, charts and sprites be used with
credit, but asks that the mod itself only be downloaded from GameJolt, so this fetches it from there
for a local server rather than the songs being shipped. data/ is gitignored.

Credits, as the mod gives them: Carlito049 (Corruption+), FellowDesert51 (Broken Wires), Phantom
Fear and Pincer (the original Corruption mod), PaperKitty (Kapi), Rechi (Skarlet Bunny), bb-panzu
(Carol).

The download is about 430 MB (the whole mod), of which the songs are about 90 MB.

    python3 tools/fnf/fetch_corruption_plus.py
    python3 tools/fnf/fetch_corruption_plus.py --from path/to/early-access-demo-plus.zip
    python3 tools/fnf/fetch_corruption_plus.py --from path/to/unpacked/mod/folder

An installed copy of the mod works as --from too (the game's folder, or its mods folder).

Each song's own game over comes along: its death sound, the music that loops and the sting on
retrying, as its gameoverjuice.lua picks them, in the song's folder as gameover-*.ogg with a
gameover.json saying which to play from when.
