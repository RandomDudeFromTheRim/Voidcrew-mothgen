/**
 * Serverblight's hunt: the one thing in the game that doesn't move tile to tile.
 *
 * The blighted body is a puck in a top-down Box2D world of its own (no gravity, a metre to a tile),
 * walled in by the dense tiles and furniture around it. It's pushed after whoever's nearest, so it
 * speeds up, overshoots, slides along walls and lurches sideways, the way things move in SS14
 * rather than the way mobs walk here. The mob follows the puck: onto whichever tile it's over, and
 * pixel-shifted the rest of the way, so it's drawn exactly where it is between tiles.
 *
 * Close enough, the ragdoll's hands go for its prey (see /datum/limb_physics/proc/set_prey()).
 * Each hand that has hold of them slows them down more, until they tear loose or get away, and
 * every hand on them every tick brings them closer to being taken: they leave their body, and
 * their body is folded into the mass, bringing more hands.
 *
 * With no gravity it can't walk: it throws itself off whatever it can reach (walls, furniture,
 * lattice, people) and drifts in between, so open space is somewhere to get away to.
 *
 * Every head in it screams, all the time, each in its own voice, distorted.
 *
 * It can be killed like anyone. Damage doesn't slow it (nothing does: it isn't walking), but a hit
 * jerks the body, and a gun that kicks, or a shot that would knock someone down, shoves it back.
 * Dead, it falls in a heap for SERVERBLIGHT_DEATH_TIME, then gets back up, whole. Something it
 * can't get back up from (no head, say) ends it.
