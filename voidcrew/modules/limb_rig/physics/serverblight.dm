/**
 * Serverblight: an admin smite that gets into a body's physics and ruins it, then sets it loose.
 *
 * Nothing here is animated. The body is made physical and hung upright by the neck from nothing,
 * and everything that keeps a ragdoll looking like a body is turned against it: every joint is
 * bent the way it doesn't go, and a motor seizes it back and forth at random every tick. The arms
 * carry on past the hands into long stiff limbs ending in six long fingers, a second pair of arms
 * comes out of the ribs, a hand comes out of the mouth, and the head splits into mirrored copies.
 * All of it collides with itself, and the solver gets too few iterations to ever settle any of
 * it: the shaking is the simulation failing to, every step.
 *
 * Then it hunts (see serverblight_chase.dm): the body slides after the nearest person without
 * walking tile to tile, and anyone it gets every hand on is taken out of their body, which joins
 * the mass.
 *
 * Turning limb physics off (the Limb Physics: Toggle admin verb) ends it and lets go of everyone.
