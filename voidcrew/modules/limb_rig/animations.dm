/**
 * What the rig does with its pieces.
 *
 * A pose is a list of part id -> joint angles:
 * - arms: "raise" (out to the side), "swing" (forward and back) and "elbow" (forearm bends forward),
 *   Arms hang off the torso, so they bend with it;
 *   "aim" instead of "swing" points the whole arm that way in the world, whatever the torso and
 *   posture are doing (90 is straight out in front). "hand_y" works the elbow out for you so the
 *   hand ends up at that height on the sprite (the face is about 26), however long the arm is.
 * - legs: "raise", "swing" and "knee" (shin bends back)
 * - head: "nod" (down is positive) and "tilt" (toward the mob's right)
 * - torso: "bend" (forward) and "lean" (toward the mob's right), plus "breath" (0.03 = 3% taller,
 *   negative squashes), and "air" (pixels the whole body is off the floor)
 * - head and torso: "skew", sheared sideways by this much (0.3 is a lot)
 * - tail (species with one): "lift" (up, degrees) and "wag" (side to side, degrees)
 * - any part: "dx" and "dy" in pixels
 *
 * Angles are in 3D terms, and the pose maths works out how they look from the way the mob is
 * facing: a raised arm points out sideways from the front and barely moves side-on, a swung
 * arm does the opposite and foreshortens from the front. So one pose works for all four
 * directions, and turning mid-animation still looks right.
 *
 * Arms and legs are two pieces each, laid along a little joint chain: shoulder to elbow to
 * hand, hip to knee to foot. Each piece gets its own complete transform rather than hanging
 * off the one above it, so foreshortening the upper arm doesn't squash the forearm too.
 * Limbs are also drawn longer than the sprite (RIG_ARM_STRETCH, RIG_LEG_STRETCH, or whatever
 * the species' limb_rig_shape says), and the body is lifted so the lowest foot always rests on
 * the floor, whatever the legs are doing. A species can also give the rig a posture, which is
 * added to every pose (a hunch, say), and its own walk.
 *
 * A sequence is a list of keyframes, each list(pose, time in deciseconds).
