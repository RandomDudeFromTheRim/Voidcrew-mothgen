 * The body every roundstart species is drawn with: a generated, shaded body a quarter bigger than
 * a human, built piece by piece like the Experiment's (see sprite_rig.dm), so an arm or leg moves
 * as a whole limb rather than a cut-out of a flat sprite.
 *
 * What makes the species stays their own. The body is tinted to each limb's colour (skin tone,
 * scales, fur; prosthetics come out their own colour). The real head goes on top, with its hair,
 * eyes, snout, horns, frills, ears and antennae, stretched onto the bigger body like a hat. Tails
 * come off the torso onto the tail bone, wings onto their own piece behind the back, and markings
 * and spines onto the torso like a shirt.
