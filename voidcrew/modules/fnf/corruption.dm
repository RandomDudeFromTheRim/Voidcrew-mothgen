/**
 * Corruption, from Carlito049's Corruption+ (a fan extension of Phantom Fear and Pincer's
 * Corruption mod): songs where a dark violet corruption eats its singers.
 *
 * A corruption song says who it starts with and when anyone changes, the way the mod does it: its
 * chart names the player, the opponent and whoever's in the girlfriend's place, and its "Change
 * Character" events swap them mid-song. Each of the mod's characters is a look and a level of
 * corruption here (GLOB.fnf_corruption_cast): Kapi goes from himself to fully corrupted over the
 * arcade songs, the corrupted Pico and Kapi fight it off and lose it again, the "bait" versions are
 * flashbacks to before. Whoever sings as the player keeps their own look and takes on the level;
 * the opponent and whoever's behind them are summoned as the mod's characters.
 *
 * Corruption spreads as it does in the mod's sprites: the far side first (the arm and leg away
 * from the crowd, the tail), then the hands go red, then the near limbs, the body and the head,
 * each piece taken over in growing dark violet splotches while every colour drains. Once the
 * head's gone, the face glows hot pink: "( • )" eyes turned on their side and a candy-corn grin.
 * Clothes it's taken go dark violet, and their bright trims glow hot pink.
 *
 * Fighting it off doesn't run that backwards. Like the mod's Pico and Kapi breaking free for a
 * while, the head comes back first (their hair, then half their face: the near eye), and the near
 * hand with it, while the body comes back only slowly and the far side stays taken.
 */

 * The mod's characters: each a look (see opponents.dm; null for nobody, just the speakers), how
 * corrupted they are, and anything else about them: "eyes" ("red" instead of pink), "wings"
 * ("angel", "demon"), "flying", and "peak": how far it had them before they started fighting it
 * off (the ones partway free).
