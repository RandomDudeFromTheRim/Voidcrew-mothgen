/**
 * A rhythm battle: two singers facing each other, the challenger on the right, the
 * opponent (a person, a mob nobody's playing, or an Experiment summoned for it) on the left.
 *
 * Keeping the song and the notes together:
 * - The song is sent to everyone listening paused, the moment it's picked, and again when a
 *   challenge goes out, so their game has it downloaded and ready while people decide.
 * - A countdown, four beats long and never under two seconds, gives the download more time.
 *   The song then starts for everyone at once by unpausing it, rather than being sent at start.
 * - Notes aren't timers fired off in advance. Every tick, each side works out where the song is
 *   from the start time, puts on screen whatever is due, and animates it to land on its exact
 *   time. Presses are judged against that same clock, corrected for the singer's ping.
