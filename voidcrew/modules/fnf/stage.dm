/**
 * Everything on a rhythm battle's stage besides the two singers singing:
 * - The girlfriend (or Nene), summoned to stand behind them, bopping to the beat and cheering. In
 *   Stress she's Pico (or Otis) up on the speaker, gunning down the tankmen who run at the stage
 *   from both sides, on the song's own speaker track. Week 4 brings Mommy's henchmen, dancing.
 * - The song's lyrics, where it has them, under the stage.
 * - Chart events that have someone do something: Boyfriend's "hey!", Tankman's "ugh", Pico's
 *   burp.
 * - Notes that are a move rather than a line. Tankman's "ugh" notes, and all of Weekend 1: in
 *   2hot Darnell lights cans and kicks them up for Pico to shoot, and Blazin' is a fistfight, every
 *   note a punch, block or dodge.
 * - What the song's stage does. Week 2's mansion gets struck by lightning, scaring everyone; Week 3's
 *   train comes rumbling past. Week 6 opens with its dialogue, and Darnell with Darnell lighting a
 *   can for Pico to shoot.
