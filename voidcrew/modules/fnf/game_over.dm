/**
 * Getting run off the health bar, Funkin' style, seen only by whoever lost.
 *
 * Everything goes black. An Experiment is left standing alone, drawn like a health doll,
 * cowering, and gets shot in the head: its head outline goes red, its head whips back, its arms
 * fling up, its knees buckle and it goes over backwards, bouncing and spraying blood, then lies
 * twitching in the spreading pool (all baked into fnf_dead.dmi, after Boyfriend's death).
 *
 * Anyone else dies like Pico does, to his game over music, acted out by their own body with the
 * rest of the world blacked out: a knife in the neck and a fountain of blood (RETRY written in the
 * blood); or, missing a shot in 2hot, the spray can blowing up in their face, leaving them charred,
 * dazed and coughing up smoke (RETRY in pink smoke); or in Blazin' a punch to the gut that folds
 * them up and drops them in their own blood (RETRY splattered under them).
 *
 * Any of them can be watched from the battle microphone's settings, without losing a song first.
 *
 * Then it waits, the game over music looping, for the singer to pick: RETRY (against the game
 * only) or GIVE UP. Until then they're down on the floor, can't touch anything, and their mic
 * stays in their hand.
 *
 * An Experiment that retries makes its last stand, as in Casualties Unknown: "Let's not give up
 * just yet." flickers over everything to a drone while the world slowly fades back in, and the
 * song counts in again as the drone ends. The new battle is set up while it's still dark, so the
 * singer is already back in their stance when the world comes back.
 *
 * The screens go through the mob's fullscreen overlays, so a HUD rebuild puts them back rather
 * than wiping them, and they land on the right plane whatever z-level the singer is on.
