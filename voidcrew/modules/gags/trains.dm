/**
 * I Like Trains (asdfmovie): they're stood in a row with two kids, in the sketch's white, on a tram
 * track. "I like singing!" "I like dancing!" Then it's their turn, and it waits for them to say it
 * (or says it for them after a while). When they do, the tram comes through and takes all three.
 * The room goes shortly after.
 *
 * In trains.dmm the track runs along y 7 to 11; they stand in the middle of it, on y 9, the kids at
 * x 12 and 13 and them at 14. The tram's tramstation's own car (tram.dmm), loaded somewhere out of
 * the way and copied onto one thing that slides through.
